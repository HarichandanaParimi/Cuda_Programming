# Cuda_Programming
 
1.This is to calulate a polynomial function F of degree d.

2. A CUDA code is written that allocates and fill an array on the CPU and transfer it to the GPU.

3. Polynomial expansion is calculated for each element of the array oon the GP.

4. Results are again bought back to CPU. 

5. Test the code with make test and the reuslts are generated in test gpu.sh.oxyz and test gpu.sh.exyz
